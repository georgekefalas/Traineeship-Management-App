# Traineeship Management Application
This repository contains the project developed for my **Software Engineering** course.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a **web-based application** for managing traineeship positions at the university.

The system allows:
- **Students** to apply for traineeship positions.  
- **Companies** to post new traineeship offers.  
- **Professors** to supervise assigned traineeships and evaluate students.  
- **Traineeship Committee Members** to manage applications and assign students to positions.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **MySQL**
- **Hibernate/JPA**
- **Maven**
- **JUnit & Mockito** (testing)

1. Import the project into your IDE as a **Maven project**.  
2. Ensure you have a valid **MySQL** installation.   
3. Update `application.properties` with your MySQL username and password.  
4. Run the application from:
   src/main/java/app/TraineeshipAppApplication.java
5. Open your browser and visit:
